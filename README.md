> ## Lifecycle of a Data Science Project:
   1. **Data Collection Strategy** from
       - company side
       - 3rd party API's
       - Surveys
       - Try to combine data from multiple data source
       
    2. **Feature Engineering**
       - Handling Missing Values
          - Reasons of missing values: people hesitate to put down the information, error in the data, survey data is not that valid.
          - Types of missing data: 
              1. Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)- A variable is missing completely at random (MCAR) if the probability of being missing is the same for all the observations. When data is MCAR, there is absolutely no relationship between the data missing and any other values, observed or missing, within the dataset. In other words, those missing data points are a random subset of the data. There is nothing systematic going on that makes some data more likely to be missing than other.
              2. Missing Data Not At Random(MNAR): Systematic missing Values
There is absolutely some relationship between the data missing and any other values, observed or missing, within the dataset.
          - Types of data : numerical(continous and discrete), categorical data
          - Handling Missing values in continuous data
